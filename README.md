##  Tech Stacks

### React Js

    React helps you create your web applications in a more maintainable way.
    React enables developer to reuse components.  
#### Components used from Ract Js
    1. useState() :- 1. useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.
                        If we write a function component and realize we need to add some state to it, previously we had to convert it to a class.
                        Now we can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
                     2. The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state. 
                     3. It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. 
    
    2. useEffect() :- 1. By using this Hook, we tell React that our component needs to do something after render. 
                         React will remember the function that we passed , and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

### React-Router
    I have used React-Router for Routing in this web application which  enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
#### Components used from react-router-dom
    1. BrowserRouter :- BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL. 
                        It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.

    2. Route :-         Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.  

    3. Switch :-         Switch component is used to render only the first route that matches the location rather than rendering all matching routes.

    4. Link :-           Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.
